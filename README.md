Main dependencies used in the project:
- React Router DOM, for routing
- Material UI, as main palette component
- Styled Components, for some custom components
- i18next, for spanish and english translations
- Axios, for some POST to my backend
- Nsfwjs, a library that uses a model created with Tensorflow JS to prevent user to upload sensitive content

### Main features
You can unlock exclusive features when registering and validating your email, but you can also have free access to look up for a player and see their season stats and current game if playing. Also you can compare two players and have a look to offers published by already registered users.

### Create your League of Legends Profile

You can register and then log in so you can type your summoner name and the app will generate your custom LoL profile with some interesting data about your last games and current season. You can save this profile as a pdf into your computer. You can refresh your profile whenever you want with updated data.


### Upload your artwork

Populate your personal gallery all the artworks and fanart you have created it. 

### Publish your offer

Want to play with some other players? You can publish an offer in the players pool billboard with your request. Just select the role you play, your gamestyle and some brief description!
